## Summary:
The data tells us there is a high bike sharing activity in NY during the month of August. Manhattan is the most popular location for people that ride the bikes, suggesting people are choosing to ride bikes more often over public transportation (i.e. buses, trains, etc.)
In addition, for future analysis, I believe making a visualization based on inventory of bikes by time frame would be important to take into consideration. Also, a visualization of the top 10 stations - that way we can make sure we have more bikes available in our top locations versus too many in locations that people do not ride them as much.
