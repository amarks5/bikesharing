# bikesharing

## Overview: 
We used data visualizations to analyze the New York Citi Bike data to help explore and project the possibility of a bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results:

This shows us the peak hours during the month of August in NYC. Bike sharing is most popular around 8am and 5pm-6pm. Which makes sense, considering those are the hours in which people are coming from and going to work. Des Moines activity will most likely reflect the same peak hours however, I don't believe the numbers will be as high as NYC is much more dense in population.

This show the average duration of each trip in NYC. I believe it would be similar in Des Moines due to this being a bike share. When people choose to use bike share they are usually closer locations. For example you wouldn't see someone use a bike share business for a two hour trip - they are more local trips.

## Summary:
The data tells us there is a high bike sharing activity in NY during the month of August. Manhattan is the most popular location for people that ride the bikes, suggesting people are choosing to ride bikes more often over public transportation (i.e. buses, trains, etc.)
In addition, for future analysis, I believe making a visualization based on inventory of bikes by time frame would be important to take into consideration. Also, a visualization of the top 10 stations - that way we can make sure we have more bikes available in our top locations versus too many in locations that people do not ride them as much.
