# bikesharing

## Overview: 
We used data visualizations to analyze the New York Citi Bike data to help explore and project the possibility of a bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results:

This shows us the peak hours during the month of August in NYC. Bike sharing is most popular around 8am and 5pm-6pm. Which makes sense, considering those are the hours in which people are coming from and going to work. Des Moines activity will most likely reflect the same peak hours however, I don't believe the numbers will be as high as NYC is much more dense in population.

This show the average duration of each trip in NYC. I believe it would be similar in Des Moines due to this being a bike share. When people choose to use bike share they are usually closer locations. For example you wouldn't see someone use a bike share business for a two hour trip - they are more local trips.

More men use the bike share service than female. However, the longer the ride the more balanced the male to female user count becomes. Also, more females use the bike sharing service for a shorter period of time compared to males.

Analyzing the heatmap, the Manhattan area is a hot spot for these bike shares. This suggests people are more likely to use bike share versus public transportation.

When looking at this heatmap you see Monday-Friday the most popular times to use bike share is 8am, 5pm-6pm. This is because those are normally the times people are going to and coming from work. However, on the weekends you see the hours sway to more middle of the day as people are out doing activities during the day versus working through the middle of the day. The broken down by gender analysis shows men are using the service more often than women.

There is a flux on weekends because people are not working. People are more likely to be out, doing activities on weekends - therefore, higher activity on weekends with broader hours.

This clearly displays males using bike share much more than women for our subscribers or annual membership holders. When you look at just customers that don't consistently use the service it is much more level between gender use.  

## Summary:
The data tells us there is a high bike sharing activity in NY during the month of August. Manhattan is the most popular location for people that ride the bikes, suggesting people are choosing to ride bikes more often over public transportation (i.e. buses, trains, etc.)
In addition, for future analysis, I believe making a visualization based on inventory of bikes by time frame would be important to take into consideration. Also, a visualization of the top 10 stations - that way we can make sure we have more bikes available in our top locations versus too many in locations that people do not ride them as much.
